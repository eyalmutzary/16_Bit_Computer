    # Parser
    
    Handles the parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to the
    input code. It reads VM commands, parses them, and provides convenient 
    access to their components. 
    In addition, it removes all white space and comments.

    ## VM Language Specification

    A .vm file is a stream of characters. If the file represents a
    valid program, it can be translated into a stream of valid assembly 
    commands. VM commands may be separated by an arbitrary number of whitespace
    characters and comments, which are ignored. Comments begin with "//" and
    last until the lineâ€™s end.
    The different parts of each VM command may also be separated by an arbitrary
    number of non-newline whitespace characters.

    - Arithmetic commands:
      - add, sub, and, or, eq, gt, lt
      - neg, not, shiftleft, shiftright
    - Memory segment manipulation:
      - push <segment> <number>
      - pop <segment that is not constant> <number>
      - <segment> can be any of: argument, local, static, constant, this, that, 
                                 pointer, temp
    - Branching (only relevant for project 8):
      - label <label-name>
      - if-goto <label-name>
      - goto <label-name>
      - <label-name> can be any combination of non-whitespace characters.
    - Functions (only relevant for project 8):
      - call <function-name> <n-args>
      - function <function-name> <n-vars>
      - return
