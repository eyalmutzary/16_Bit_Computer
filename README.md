## Introduction

The 16 Bit Computer project is a labor of love for computer enthusiasts who want to explore the inner workings of a computer system. This project is unique in that it not only simulates a 16-bit computer but also introduces a custom programming language called "Jack" for software development.

## Features

### Compiler
- A complete [compiler](compiler-folder-link) that translates high-level Jack code into virtual machine code, assembly, and binary code (Hack).
- Jack is a custom-made programming language, providing a unique experience for developers.

### Hardware
- A hardware simulation written in Python, meticulously crafted from basic logic gates (e.g., [NAND](hardware-folder-link), [AND](hardware-folder-link), [XOR](hardware-folder-link)) to complex components like ALU, CPU, and Memory.
- The hardware closely mimics real-world logic, offering a deep understanding of computer architecture.

### Operating System
- A fully functional [operating system](os-folder-link) designed to run on the 16 Bit Computer.
- Includes features like memory management, mathematical operations, visual screen management, and basic data structures like arrays.

### User Interface
- A user-friendly [UI](ui-design-link) designed to interact with the computer system.
- Users can write and execute Jack scripts through a backend server, providing a seamless experience for creating and running code.
- The UI design is available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for preview and customization.
